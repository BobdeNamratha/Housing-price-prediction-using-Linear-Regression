# Housing-price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting housing prices using linear regression. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in statistical modeling and machine learning, particularly for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more input features.

In this project, we utilize a dataset comprising various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and other relevant factors to predict the price of houses. We employ the linear regression algorithm to build a predictive model that estimates the housing prices based on these features.

# Key Features:

**1.** **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

**2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the distribution of features, identifying correlations, and gaining insights into the relationships between variables.
   
**3.Model Training:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting a linear regression model to the training data, and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.

**4.Model Evaluation:**  Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and visualizing the predicted versus actual housing prices.

**5.Feature Engineering:** Exploring feature importance, conducting feature selection, and potentially engineering new features to improve model performance.

**6.Deployment:** Providing guidelines or scripts for deploying the trained model into production environments, enabling real-time predictions.


This project serves as a practical example for those interested in learning about linear regression, machine learning modeling, and housing price prediction. Additionally, it offers insights into the data preprocessing steps and model evaluation techniques crucial for building accurate predictive models.

Feel free to explore the code, data, and documentation provided in this repository to understand the process of developing a linear regression-based housing price prediction model. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated.
